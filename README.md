<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## ville.Connect

**ville.Connect** is a [Qooxdoo](https://qooxdoo.org/) control designed to visually connect widgets on a canvas type layout.

## The Big Idea
Create a diagram/workflow/mindmap, tool/widget/capability using 100% Qooxdoo code and objects. No SVG or Canvas HTML tags, if at all possible.

<!-- DEMOS -->
## Demos

[Demo](https://sqville.github.io/ville.Connect/published/)
* Right click any connector to edit the object
* Move or resize connected widgets to see the connection dyanmically adjust (only enabled for first two examples. The third example are static ui widgets.)

<!-- ROADMAP -->
## Roadmap

* Create and modify simple scenarios and connection types with the ability to export changes to a single json object (In progress)
* Add shapes and connections using UI (i.e. drag and drop) (In progress)
* Read from and export to, Excalidraw and Mermaidjs file formats (Not started)
